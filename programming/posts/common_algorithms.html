        <h2 class="h-font">What are Algorithms?</h2>
        <p class="p-font">
          Algorithms, even though thought of as a scary topic, are pretty simple tools that we can use to perform complex tasks. An algorithm is simply a sequence of instructions used to solve a specific problem. Within computer science, we also tend to include heuristics in this definition but that is a topic more related to machine learning and data science.
        </p>
        <p class="p-font">
          I know, this definition probably doesn't clarify the question we are asking here, so let's dive a little bit deeper into the topic by looking at some key characteristics of algorithms in computer scinece.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h-font">Key Characterstics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Well Defined Input(s):</strong> Not all algorithms accept inputs, but if one does, they must be clearly defined. This means that the input <em>must</em> satisfy the expected format, type, and constraints defined by the algorithm. This allows the algorithm to correctly process the input without ambiguity or error.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Well Defined Output(s):</strong> The algorithm should produce at least one output. And, similar to the input(s), <em>must</em> be clearly defined to prevent ambiguity or error. This means the output should match the expected format and type defined by the algorithm.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Finite:</strong> The algorithm should terminate after a finite amount of time.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Deterministic:</strong> The algorithm <em>must</em> give the same output for the same input case every time.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Language Agnostic:</strong> The algorithm <em>cannot</em> only be implemented in a specific language. The instructions should be able to be implemented in any language. This means that if you code an implementation in C, Java, and Python that as long as you provide the same inputs, all languages should provide the same output.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="p-font">
            <strong>Effective:</strong> Each operation within the algorithm should be simple and easy to follow so that anyone who can read code can follow each step of the process. Each instruction should also do some amount of work.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="h-font">Why Use Algorithms?</h2>
        <p class="p-font">
          Algorithms are useful because they provide structured, efficient, and reliable solutions to many of our programming problems. Using algorithms allows us as programmers to optimize resource usage by using the most time and space efficient algorithm available for a given task. Good algorithms can also handle larger amounts of data without significant slowdown. For example, binary search is great at scale for searching sorted arrays since it has a time complexity of <code>O(log(n))</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="p-font">
            Algorithms are also great because they are both reusable and predictable. Algorithms often provide us solutions to common problems and once an algorithm is developed, can be reused with little to no modification. This is because for a given problem, they provide predictable results. This is critical for debugging and program reliability.
        </p>
        <p class="p-font">
          Algorithms also provide a foundation for comparing solutions and improving systems through metrics such as time complexity, space complexity, and accuracy. By utilizing algorithms that are well designed, programmers can create faster, more reliable, and scalable systems. These systems are the backbone of modern computing.
