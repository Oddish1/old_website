        <h2 class="h-font">Who is Oddish1?</h2>
        <p class="p-font">
          I am currently a computer science student and am looking forward to getting a job in the summer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h-font">Stats</h3>
        <ul class="p-font">

        <h3 class="h-font">Favorites</h3>
        <p class="p-font">
          These lists are by no means complete, and are really just compiled off the top of my head. Over time I will come back to refresh them, in the hopes of one day making complete lists. But for now this'll have to do. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
        </p>
        <h4 class="h-font">&#128366; Books &#128366;</h4>
        <p class="p-font">
          I am generally partial to science-fiction or fantasy books. But I do like a lot of other types of books.
        </p>
        <ul class="p-font">
          <li>The Midnight Library (2020); Matt Haig</li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h-font">&#9835; Music &#9835;</h4>
        <p class="p-font">
          I like basically any and all music that exists. So it's always a tough question to answer, "what is your favorite music".
        </p>
        <ul class="p-font">
          <li>The entire Minecraft Soundtrack</li>
          <li>Pretty much all classical music</li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h-font">&#128253; Movies &#128253;</h4>
        <p class="p-font">
          Fun fact: My first job was working at a movie theater in high school. I really like movies!

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h-font">&#127902; TV &#127902;</h4>
        <p class="p-font">
          I watch too much tv... but I also really enjoy it. I realize some of the shows on this list are objectively not very good, but we as individuals have <em>only</em> subjective opinions... so... this is what I like.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h-font">&#128430; Video Games &#128430;</h4>
        <p class="p-font">
          I really enjoy video games, but don't play them all that much for some reason...? As a result I have a big backlog of games to play ◉_◉
        </p>
        <ul class="p-font">
          <li>Minecraft (2011)</li>

          <li>Crusader Kings 3 (2020)</li>
          <li>Stardew Valley (2016)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h-font">What is This Place?</h2>
        <p class="p-font">
          This site acts as a place for me to put whatever I want on the internet! (ᵔᴥᵔ) I have always admired websites of old with simple html/css and maybe a slight amount of php or javascript to add light functionality. That is the web that I grew up on. Then social media came around and everyone stopped making websites. Fastforward to about a year ago, and I started to realize that some people still did make their own websites. I learned about the indie web or small web or whatever people want to call it. So I decided to completely forgo social media (except youtube for now) in favor of just posting things on my own site.
        </p>
        <p class="p-font">
          I have already been more active here than I really ever have been on my own social media accounts. I never liked the lack of creative expression most social media affords it's users. This will be a place for me to nerd out on things that I like, share whatever I want, and hopefully inspire some other people to do the same.
        </p>
        <p class="p-font">
          HTML and CSS are easy to learn and I really think that everybody can and should build their own personal websites from scratch ... maybe some day I will write my own indie web manifesto. >_>
