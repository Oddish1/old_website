## What is this site for?

This is my personal website. A place for me to post all of the things I want to share wether it's what I'm up to on a daily basis or things that I want to share that I think are cool! I have many interests and hobbies, so the site will span many different topics of interest of mine.

Through this website I would like to showcase what websites really **should** be like in the modern day. In my opinion, modern websites are full of either AI generated garbage, *and* bloated javascript frameworks that do things nobody really needs on most websites. Of course, I am still learning, so I don't have concrete fixes for any of the gripes listed here or often heard online from others. But I am looking forward to learning and developing this site from a more minimalistic perspective.

## What do modern websites use and what are the alternatives?
